Our project is focused on building a web-based movie database using Django, which is a popular Python-based web framework. The goal of this project is to create an online platform that will allow users to perform four basic operations related to movie records: creating, reading, updating, and deleting.

This movie database will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that will enable users to store and manage information about movies they have watched or plan to watch in the future.

Through this project, we hope to provide a convenient and centralized way for users to keep track of their movie-related information. With the help of our movie database, users can easily add new movies they have watched, update existing records with more accurate information, or remove records for movies they no longer wish to keep track of.

To start, the user will need to create his account by providing the necessary information. This data will be stored in the database. Once, all the criteria for creating the account are satisfied, the user will be prompted to the login page, where they'll need to log in using his account. If the username and password match, they'll be redirected to the read page, where they can see the list of all the movies. If the user is an admin, functionality to create, update and delete will be provided to them. If the user is not an admin, he can only read the data.

Admin can create a new movie record by clicking on the "Create Movie" button on the navigation bar. This will take them to a form where they can enter the required information. Once they have filled out the form and submitted it, a new record will be created in the database.

Next, to view the movies they have added to the database, users can click on the "Read Movies" button on the navigation bar. This will display a list of all the movies in the database, along with their details. This allows users to keep track of the movies they have added to the database and easily find the information they need about each movie.

If a user needs to update any information about a movie, they can do so by clicking on the "Update" button next to the movie they want to edit in the list of movies. This will take them to a form where they can make the necessary changes to the movie record. Once the changes have been made, the updated information will be saved to the database.

Lastly, if a user wants to remove a movie record from the database, they can do so by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the "Update" button in the navigation bar. This will remove the selected movie record from the database and the user will no longer be able to access that information.
